title: Handle Refund Errors
desc: Check the errors that may occur while processing Refunds and how to handle these errors.

Sometimes when you try to process a refund request, it fails to get processed and you may encounter BADREQUESTERROR messages stating refunds are not supported. This happens because most of the banks do not support refunds for payments that are more than 6 months old.

List of Possible Refund Errors

{
  "error": {
    "code": "BADREQUESTERROR",
    "description": "Payment is more than 6 months old, only instant refund is supported",
    "source": null,
    "step": null,
    "reason": null,
    "metadata": {}
  }
}

You can try to process such refunds using Instant Refund. To check the refund status, navigate to the Refund Details pop-up by clicking on the specific Refund Id under the Transactions â†’ Refunds tab.

You can get the ARN/RRN for successfully processed refunds on the Razorpay Dashboard Refunds tab or using the Fetch Refund API. This is a unique reference number which can be used by the customers to track refunds.

Instant Refund Fee

We charge a small fee to process instant refunds.

If Instant Refund for a payment that is more than 6 months old is not supported, an error message is displayed on the Refund Payment pop-up.

You will encounter the following error code and error message in the API response:

{
  "error": {
    "code": "BADREQUESTERROR",
    "description": "Refund is not supported by the bank because the payment is more than 6 months old",
    "source": null,
    "step": null,
    "reason": null,
    "metadata": {}
  }
}

Instant Refund Fee Reversal

If the instant refund fails, any fee charged will be reversed to your account.
