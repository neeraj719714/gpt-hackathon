desc:  Initiate normal and instant refunds to your customers using Razorpay's Refund APIs. View and update refund using APIs.
index: true

You can make full or partial refunds to customers. While issuing refunds, you can choose to process:
Normal Refunds (refund within 5-7 working days, no additional charges)
Instant Refunds (instant refunds, nominal additional charges)

Know more about Refunds.

Refunds Can be Made Only on Captured Payments

You can initiate refunds only on those payments that are in captured state. A payment in authorized state is auto-refunded if not captured within 5 days of creation.

You can try out our APIs on the Razorpay Postman Public Workspace.

Run in Postman

Use Cases

Create a normal refund to build customer trust by seamlessly managing their expectations.
Create an instant refund to provide a better user experience for them.
Retrieve information about all refunds.
Retrieve details for a specific refund using the unique identifier linked to the refund.

Refund Entity

The Refund entity has the following fields:

id
: string The unique identifier of the refund. For example, rfnd_FgRAHdNOM4ZVbO.

entity
: string Indicates the type of entity. Here, it is refund.

amount
: integer The amount to be refunded (in the smallest unit of currency).  For example, refund in INR, a value of 100 means 100 paise (equivalent to ₹1).

currency
: string The currency of payment amount for which the refund is initiated. Check the list of supported currencies.

payment_id
: string The unique identifier of the payment for which a refund is initiated. For example, pay_FgR9UMzgmKDJRi.

speed
: string Speed at which the refund is to be processed. Possible values:
  normal: Indicates that the refund will be processed via the normal speed. The refund will take 5-7 working days.
  optimum: Indicates that the refund will be processed at an optimal speed based on Razorpay's internal fund transfer logic.
    If the refund can be processed instantly, Razorpay will do so, irrespective of the payment method used to make the payment.
    If an instant refund is not possible, Razorpay will initiate a refund that is processed at the normal speed. For example, in case of payments made using debit cards, netbanking or unsupported credit cards.

created_at
: integer Unix timestamp at which the refund was created. For example, 1600856650.

batch_id
: string This parameter is populated if the refund was created as part of a batch upload. For example, batch_00000000000001

notes
: json object Key-value store for storing your reference data. A maximum of 15 key-value pairs can be included. For example, "note_key": "Beam me up Scotty”.

receipt
: string A unique identifier provided by you for your internal reference.

acquirer_data
: array A dynamic array consisting of a unique reference number (either RRN, ARN or UTR) that is provided by the banking partner when a refund is processed. This reference number can be used by the customer to track the status of the refund with the bank.

status
: string Indicates the state of the refund. Possible values:
  pending: This state indicates that Razorpay is attempting to process the refund.
  processed: This is the final state of the refund.
  failed: A refund can attain the failed state in the following scenarios:
    Normal refund is not possible for a payment which is more than 6 months old.
    Instant Refund can sometimes fail because of customer's account or bank-related issues.

speed_requested
: string The processing mode of the refund seen in the refund response.  This attribute is seen in the refund response only if the speed parameter is set in the refund request.Possible values:
  normal: Indicates that the refund will be processed via the normal speed. The refund will take 5-7 working days.
  optimum: Indicates that the refund will be processed at an optimal speed based on Razorpay's internal fund transfer logic.
    If the refund can be processed instantly, Razorpay will do so, irrespective of the payment method used to make the payment.
    If an instant refund is not possible, Razorpay will initiate a refund that is processed at the normal speed.

speed_processed
: string This is a parameter in the response which describes the mode used to process a refund.  This attribute is seen in the refund response only if the speed parameter is set in the refund request. Possible values:
  instant: Indicates that the refund has been processed instantly via fund transfer.
  normal: Indicates that the refund has been processed by the payment processing partner. The refund will take 5-7 working days.

You can create and manage refunds using APIs or from the Razorpay Dashboard.
