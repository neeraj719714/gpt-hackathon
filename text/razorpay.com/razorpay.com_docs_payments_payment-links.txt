List of Supported Payment Methods
Online Payment 
Customers can make online payments using Card, UPI, NetBanking, Wallet, EMI, Pay Later and Bank Transfer options.
International Currency Support

Address Verification System
If you are accepting international payments, you can use Razorpay's Address Verification System (AVS). AVS verifies if a customer's billing address (postal code and the billing street address) matches the billing address on file with the card issuer. Based on the response from the issuer, Razorpay will accept or cancel the transaction. This helps in the prevention of fraud in international payments.
