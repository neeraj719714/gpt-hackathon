Non Aadmi Party
                  By the people, for the people, of the internet.The time is ripe for a change in the way our
                  great country is governed. The time is apt for the citizens to get what they deserve. If real
                  intelligence has been failed to be intelligent, it is time for artificial intelligence to take
                  over.Your next Prime Minister hasnât ever served chAI, hasnât ever sheltered underworld ke
                  bhAI, hasnât ever dissed movies by Subhash GhAI. Your next Prime Minister is not an aadmi, it is a
                  cloud-based, omnipotent and omnipresent AI engine. Itâs motherly, homely and an intelligent candidate.
                  We call it AAI.Hereâs introducing Non Aadmi Party and itâs motherly, homely and intelligent
                  candidate--AAI.Itâs transparent, itâs open, itâs omnipresent. Itâs not your friend, itâs not
                  your enemy. Itâs you. PM AAI is such a beacon of intelligence that it knows you better than you know
                  yourself. It understands your needs, your desires, your aspirations. PM AAI will fix open manholes
                  even before children fall into them, PM AAI will provide jobs even before youngsters finish their
                  education.The Non Aadmi Party is a political startup. Startups have successfully changed the
                  way we run businesses; Non Aadmi Party will successfully change the way governments are
                  run.Here is why you should choose Non Aadmi Party and AAI, the artificial intelligence PM, in
                  the upcoming elections.
We donât want just your votes, we want your upvotes.

Transparent funding activities
Traditional political parties donât disclose their funding sources, but
                  being a political startup, it will probably be the only thing that Non Aadmi Party talks about. Get
                  used to newspaper headlines like, âNon Aadmi Party Raises $100 million in Series A Fundingâ or
                  âMultiple VCs Lead New Funding Round in NAP.â Weâll talk about funding even when we are not receiving
                  any funding but want to stay in the news. We will be open to talking about our funding sources, but
                  please donât ask us how and where we are spending the money. Much like traditional parties, we also
                  wonât know but we definitely will be the worldâs first unicorn government.
Cooler names for our cities
Startups have cool names, why shouldnât our cities have that too? Since
                  there are so many breweries in Bangalore, weâll rename it to Brewgalore. Mumbai and Chennai, of
                  course, will become Mumb.ai and Chenn.ai. Unconfirmed sources have told us that there are numerous
                  Dell outlets in Delhi, which is why weâll rename it to DellKart. After this, weâll just start skipping
                  vowels, replacing iâs with yâs, etc. to better startup-ize our cities. Expect Hydrbd, Ahmdvd, Pn,
                  Jypor, and Gandyngrrr.
Great job titles for our cabinet ministers 
It is rather dull to call someone the âMinister of Human Resource
                  Developmentâ; weâll call this post the Head of People Ops. The âMinister of Social Justice and
                  Empowermentâ title doesnât adequately reflect our culture, so itâll be replaced by Chief Social Media
                  Influencer. The guy heading the Ministry of Consumer Affairs, Food and Public will be naturally be
                  called our companyâs Growth Hacker, and the Minister of Defence will henceforth be Chief Defence
                  Ninja.
A government of open offices
Open offices have been the startup world's contribution to modernizing the
                  way we work. The Non Aadmi Party offices will also be open offices. Any citizen can walk into any of
                  our offices at any point in time. You can participate in the discussions party workers and government
                  officials are having. And if by chance you find anyone taking a nap in a government office, take a nap
                  with them.
Pay income tax and get instant cashback
Wow! Literally, wow! Has any government ever given you money to pay money?
                  We will. Every time your company deducts TDS or professional tax from your salary, Non Aadmi Party
                  will deposit cashback directly into a wallet of your choice. Cash has gone but cash came back also!
                  The party will also report income tax collections as Gross Merchandise Value and aim to achieve
                  hockeystick growth.
A revamped Parliament
In our opinion, Parliament House has been waiting for a startup to occupy
                  it. Perhaps this is why they already sport an open office layout. To add to this, the Parliament under
                  the Non Aadmi Party will sport a completely new look. It will only have bean bags, but members will
                  show appreciation not by banging on tables but by upvoting Non Aadmi Party on Product Hunt. Every LS
                  and RS session will be planned in fortnightly sprints, the sessions will be streamed on the partyâs
                  own channel called NAPflix and of course, the Parliament will have ping pong and foosball tables to
                  allow our ministers to stay fit and energized.
Citizens can review cabinets on Glassdoor
If youâd like to tell us what weâre doing, you can review us on Glassdoor!
                  The Non Aadmi Party aims to be an open and transparent government, which is why there will be no need
                  to open a Glassdoor account to look at all Glassdoor reviews -- they will be open for all. If, like
                  startup founders and product managers, our ministers also reply to everything that Naval tweets, you
                  can go ahead and give them negative reviews on Glassdoor.
Social crimes on IPC
With changing times, the traditional definitions of crime have also
                  changed, and weâve decided to update them. Calling yourself a âsapiosexualâ and âonly here for
                  friendsâ on Tinder, or sending good morning messages on WhatsApp, or calling your blog âRandom
                  Musingsâ, or adding âWriterâ to your Twitter bio should all be unlawful activities. And they will be.
                  The Non Aadmi Party will ensure that such social crimes are recognized and penalized.
Cloudy skies over clear skies
Clouds are amazing. Look at our party symbol if you have any doubts. We
                  love clouds so much that we'll make them omnipresent in our skies. We'll get rid of firewalls and data
                  centres and move all your data to the clouds. More clouds will also mean more rain for our farmers,
                  and will also mean the citizens will be protected from harmful UV rays. Safety, security and
                  kheti-badi, all in one.
Ab sabke mann ki baat
Communication is important. A government should reach out to the citizens
                  more often and hear what they have to say. Instead of a radio speech (which is hardly the way to reach
                  Millenials), the Non Aadmi Party will host a Town Hall meeting every Sunday. Our honourable PM AAI
                  will speak to the citizens of the country and take questions. For a short period of time, of course.
                  And there will be pizza!
Abolish Angel Tax
Startups in India have been affected by the infamous Angel Tax regulation,
                  which imposes taxation on VC investments in unlisted companies. However, with our superior
                  intelligence, we will out-general this regulation by allowing VC funding via electoral bonds. This
                  will not only allow all investments to be tax-free, but also allow all donations to be completely
                  anonymous!*
                  * - In doing so, we expect we will be just the start of a long line of startups attempting to get into
                  politics once everyone realizes its potential for tax-free investments. But this government has first
                  mover advantage!
Better planning, better tracking, Jira for all!
Older, dated government 5-year-plans will be replaced with the Non Aadmi
                  Partyâs own Startup Sprint Plan. Our new quarter planning scheme will be Vision 2025, and to help us
                  achieve our goals, we shall define public OKRs for all senior government positions. As you would
                  expect, their adherence to these OKRs will affect their appraisals during review cycles, determined
                  via extensive anonymous peer review. Who needs NITI Aayog when youâve got a national-level Scrum
                  Master?
Wildlife Conservation
If thereâs one thing the Non Aadmi Party is great at, itâs using technology
                  to solve problems you never even knew existed. Non Aadmi Party will use established, robust methods of
                  ensuring that the animals of this country are not just safe, but live forever! Get ready to look
                  beyond CryptoCows, and move on to ROIRhinos, HODLHaathis, Royal Bengal TigerTokens, and of course,
                  Blackbucks.
VotEr Stock Ownership Plan (VESOPS)
Finally, what kind of startup would we really be if we didnât intend on
                  someday going public? Get in on the craze now, as every member of the voting public who pledges their
                  vote to NAP will be entitled to a percentage of ownership of the country. Whatâs that you say? How can
                  a country be owned via stocks? Well, letâs just say that if war ever breaks out and territories of
                  India have to be seceded acquired, youâre in for a huge buyback!
