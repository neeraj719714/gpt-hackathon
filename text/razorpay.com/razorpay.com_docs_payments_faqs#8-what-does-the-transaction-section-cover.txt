3. Is it similar to wallet payments?
Razorpay is not a wallet provider. We enable businesses to accept payments and make payouts using various payment methods.

This drastically reduces the customer drop-off ratio, resulting in high profits for the buisness.

All queries relating to full or partial cancellationof orders should be routed to the seller since we are a payment gateway and only facilitate online payments for sellers. As we do not handle shipping or order dispatch, you should directly contact the seller for any queries.
