Test IntegrationSteps to test if the CS-Cart integration was successful.After the integration is complete, Razorpay is added as a payment option on your web page/app. You need to click the button and make a test transaction to ensure that the integration is working as expected. You can start accepting actual payments from your customers once the test is successful.

You can make test payments using one of the payment methods configured at the Checkout.

No money is deducted from the customer's account as this is a simulated transaction.
Ensure you have entered the API keys generated in the test mode in the Checkout code.

Netbanking
You can select any of the listed banks. After choosing a bank, Razorpay will redirect to a mock page where you can make the payment a success or a failure. Since it is the test mode, we will not redirect you to the bank login portals.
UPI
You can enter one of the following UPI IDs:

success@razorpay: To make the payment successful.
failure@razorpay: To fail the payment.

Handy TipsUPI Payments should be tested in Live Mode.
Wallet
You can select any of the listed wallets. After choosing a wallet, Razorpay will redirect to a mock page where you can make the payment a success or a failure. Since it is the test mode, we will not redirect you to the wallet login portals.
Cards
You can use one of the test cards to make transactions in the test mode. Use any valid expiration date in the future and any random CVV to create a successful payment.
