Fees: The fees that Razorpay charges you to make a payout. This is charged according to your pricing plan.


Tax: This is the GST on the fees, as per government regulations. This is collected by the government.


Refer to RazorpayX Pricing.
Billing for Payouts
Discover how fees and taxes and credits are applicable to payouts made through RazorpayX.
Payouts from RazorpayX Lite
When you make a payout using RazorpayX Lite, the fees and taxes are charged as a part of the payout in real-time.
Example
For a payout of â¹10,000, the fees applicable is â¹5 and the tax on this is â¹0.90.
When you make a payout â¹10,000 from RazorpayX Lite:

â¹10,005.90 (â¹10,000+ â¹5 + â¹0.90) is deducted from RazorpayX Lite balance.
â¹10,000 is credited to your contact.
â¹5 (fees) is credited to Razorpay.
â¹0.90 (tax) collected by the government.

In case of a payout reversal, the fees and tax are also reversed.
Payouts from Current Account
When you make a payout from your Current Account, the fees and tax is not deducted in real-time as part of the payout.
Instead, the fees and tax are collected on a regular frequency and appear as a payout in your account statement. This is an automated process and does not require any action from you.
Example
The fees and tax on all payouts made in the 1st week of January, that is, between January 01 to January 07, is calculated and collected on January 08. The collection then appears as a payout in your account statement.
Handy TipsFor reversals, amount = (original payout amount + fees + tax). Fee and tax for reversals appear with a minus symbol. This is to indicate they are returned to you and also help with your reconciliation.
Free Payouts
You have a few Free Payouts available when you sign up with RazorpayX. Know more about Free Payouts.

Apart from the various fields in the report containing details of each transaction, the following are two important fields:

fee_id

RazorpayX Lite: auto_paid, because the fees and tax is collected as part of the payout.
Current account: This column contains a unique identifier associated with the fee and tax collected. This is because, for current accounts, fees and tax are collected on a regular frequency and not on a per payout basis. Multiple payouts can have the same fee_id.


fee_created_at

RazorpayX Lite: This column will be blank because the fees and tax is collected as part of the payout.
Current account: The date and time when the fee and tax collection was initiated by RazorpayX.


fee_type

free_payout: Indicates a Free Payout was used to process the payout. In such scenarios, you are not charged any fees and tax. Only the payout amount is deducted from your account balance.
