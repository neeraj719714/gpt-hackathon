Create Linked Accounts
To transfer funds to various third parties, sellers, bank accounts or vendors, you need to add them as Linked Accounts.
When you add a Linked Account, you gain complete visibility and control of all the fund movements such as transfers, reversals and refunds for each of your Linked Accounts.
Every Linked Account has a unique account_id which should be stored in your database. This ID should be sent in the various APIs described in other sections to identify the Linked Account.
Watch Out!
After being added, the Linked Account gets activated immediately and funds can be transferred right away. However, it takes 2 working days for Linked Account settlements, irrespective of your settlement schedule.

Penny Testing
To avoid settlement failure, we will penny test Linked Accounts when added. Razorpay will transfer a nominal amount to the bank account details submitted to verify them. Transfers are allowed only on successful validation. This will be performed on the newly created Linked Accounts and the existing accounts when the bank account details are updated via the Dashboard.
