Usually, this data is maintained in an accounting tool or structured folders for bookkeeping, auditing and tax filing and periodically sent via email or uploaded into shared folders (like Google Drive or Dropbox) for stakeholders to access.
With the RazorpayX Chartered Accountant Portal, you can access and download a host of reports that you would need to maintain financial data.
