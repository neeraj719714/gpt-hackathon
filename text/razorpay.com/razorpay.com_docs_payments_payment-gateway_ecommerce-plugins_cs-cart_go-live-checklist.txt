Accept Live Payments
You can perform an end-to-end simulation of funds flow in the Test Mode. Once confident that the integration is working as expected, switch to the Live Mode and start accepting payments from customers.
Watch Out!Ensure you are switching your test API keys with API keys generated in Live Mode.
To generate API Keys in Live Mode on your Razorpay Dashboard:

Log in to the Razorpay Dashboard and switch to Live Mode on the menu.
Navigate to Settings â API Keys â Generate Key to generate the API Key for Live Mode.
Download the keys and save them securely.
Replace the Test API Key with the Live Key in the Checkout code and start accepting actual payments.

Payment Capture
After payment is authorized, you need to capture it to settle the amount to your bank account as per the settlement schedule. Payments that are not captured are auto-refunded after a fixed time.


Auto-capture payments (recommended)
Authorized payments can be automatically captured. You can auto-capture all payments using global settings on the Razorpay Dashboard.
Watch Out!Payment capture settings work only if you have integrated with Orders API on your server side. Know more about the Orders API.


Manually capture payments
Each authorized payment can also be captured individually. You can manually capture payments using:
