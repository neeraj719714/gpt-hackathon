This happens because most of the banks do not support refunds for payments that are more than 6 months old.
List of Possible Refund Errors

You can try to process such refunds using Instant Refund. To check the refund status, navigate to the Refund Details pop-up by clicking on the specific Refund Id under the Transactions â Refunds tab.
You can get the ARN/RRN for successfully processed refunds on the Razorpay Dashboard Refunds tab or using the Fetch Refund API. This is a unique reference number which can be used by the customers to track refunds.
Instant Refund FeeWe charge a small fee to process instant refunds.
If Instant Refund for a payment that is more than 6 months old is not supported, an error message is displayed on the Refund Payment pop-up.
You will encounter the following error code and error message in the API response:
Error Responsecopy{  "error": {    "code": "BAD_REQUEST_ERROR",    "description": "Refund is not supported by the bank because the payment is more than 6 months old",    "source": null,    "step": null,    "reason": null,    "metadata": {}  }}
