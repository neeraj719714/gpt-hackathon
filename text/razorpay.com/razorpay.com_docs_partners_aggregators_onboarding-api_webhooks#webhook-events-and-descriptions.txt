Webhook Events and Descriptions
There are 2 types of events:

Transaction Events: These are events related to payment transactions performed by the sub-merchants. The partner at a sub-merchant level can configure these events.
Sub-Merchant Onboarding Events: These events are related to the onboarding status of the sub-merchant. This is subscribed at the partner level and not configurable at the sub-merchant level. Subscribing to this event will enable the partner to get the onboarding status of all sub-merchants.
