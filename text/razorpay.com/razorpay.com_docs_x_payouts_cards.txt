Payouts to Cards
According to the RBI guidelines, merchants cannot save their customerâs card credentials (card number & other card data) on their own servers.
To save a card number, you can use a tokenisation service like Razorpay TokenHQ. Payouts to these tokenised cards can be made using the âcardâ mode on RazorpayX.
After collecting card number from the customer, there are 3 ways to make the payout:


Make a payout via RazorpayX payouts to cards APIs. Here, the card numbers will not be saved. You have to collect the card number from the customer each time a payout is made.


Tokenise the card with Razorpay TokenHQ and make a payout to the token via RazorpayX.

Cards have to be tokenised with a token service provider via a Razorpay TokenHQ.
Tokenisation is not available via RazorpayX APIs.
