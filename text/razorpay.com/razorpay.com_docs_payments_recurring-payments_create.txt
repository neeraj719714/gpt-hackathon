Handy TipsUnlike integrating recurring payments from APIs, you do not have to create the order or the customer separately while integrating from the dashboard. The customer will be added when creating a registration link, and an order will be created when the customer makes the authentication payment.
1. Create a Registration Link
To create a registration link:

Log in to the Razorpay Dashboard.
Under PAYMENT PRODUCTS, navigate to Subscription â Registration Links.
Click +Create New Link and follow the on-screen instructions.

The registration link is sent to the customer. Once a customer successfully makes the authorisation payment, you need to wait for the payment to reach the captured state.
