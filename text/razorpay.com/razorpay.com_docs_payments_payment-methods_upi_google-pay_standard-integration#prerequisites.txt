Web Integration
Collect flow
On your website, all Google Pay requests will be Collect requests. The customer selects the Google Pay option, enters their UPI handle and clicks Pay. A request is sent to the Google Pay app installed on their mobile device. The customer has to manually open the Google Pay app and approve the request.
Intent flow
Customers can make intent-based payments using Google Pay on mobile-web applications. Here, the customer is redirected to Google Payâs application, installed on their mobile devices, to complete the payment.
Watch Out!This feature is only available for web pages running on HTTPS on Google Chrome for Android (v56 and above) and not on Google Chrome web views.
Feature RequestThis is an on-demand feature. Please raise a request with our Support team to get this feature activated on your Razorpay account.
Android Integration
Collect-Based Integration
This is same as UPI Collect Integration.
The customers enter their UPI handle in the Enter your UPI ID section on the Checkout form and click Pay. Collect the customer's UPI handle and pass it in the payment request with method as upi.
Razorpay then triggers a Collect request. The Collection request is sent to the customer's Google Pay application where they can make the payment.

Intent-Based Integration
When using the Standard Checkout, Google Pay is shown inside the payment method UPI. The customer selects Google Pay from the list of apps and click Pay. Customers are then redirected to the Google Pay application, provided it is installed on the mobile device they are using to access checkout, where they can make the payment.
Intent-Based Integration Using Google Pay SDK
You also have the option to integrate Google Pay with the Standard Checkout on your Android app using Google's SDK.
This offers the advantage of letting you open Google Pay within your application for customers to make the payment without any redirection, enhancing the user experience.
Prerequisites

Sign up for a business account with Google Pay.
Contact our Support Team and have them whitelist your UPI ID/VPA.
Verify your UPI ID/VPA details on the Google Merchant Console. Here, Google deposits a small amount into the bank account linked to your VPA (UPI ID).
You should have already integrated Razorpay Standard Checkout.
Generate API Keys from the Dashboard.

To integrate Google Pay with the Checkout on your Android app using Google's SDK:


Download the following SDKs and add the .aar files to the application library.

Google Pay SDK.

Handy TipsThe Razorpay-Google Pay SDK acts as a wrapper over the native Google-SDK. This SDK connects Razorpay's SDK with the Google SDK. You need all the 3 SDKs (listed below) for the flow to work.
Razorpay Android SDK
Google Pay SDK
Razorpay-Google Pay SDK



Add the following lines of code to the build.gradle file of your application:


build.gradlecopydependencies {      implementation(name: 'razorpay-googlepay-1.3.0', ext: 'aar')      implementation(name:'google-pay-client-api-1.0.0  ', ext:'aar')      implementation 'com.android.support:customtabs:26.1.0'      implementation 'com.google.android.gms:play-services-tasks:15.0.1    }
This will add the dependencies for the SDK and create a Google Pay UPI payment method on your Checkout form.
