In cases where the Instant refund fails and the refund takes 5-7 working days, the levied fee is credited back to your balance. The fee break-up is shown in the end-of-the-month invoice generated by Razorpay. View and download the details of fees charged in the Instant Refunds Reports from the Razorpay Dashboard.
