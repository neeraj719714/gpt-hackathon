Plan linked to the Subscription.


Quantity, that is the number of times the amount should be charged to the customer per billing cycle. For example, this would be the number of users for a software product.


Subscription Start Date for the updated Subscription details. This can either be immediate or any future date. You can choose to update a Subscription:


Immediately


At the end of the current billing cycle




Total count, that is the number of billing cycles. This determines the duration of the Subscription.


Offer, this is the offer linked to the Subscription.
Watch Out!You can only update the offer linked to the Subscription at the end of the cycle. It is not possible to update an offer linked to a Subscription immediately.


Example
A customer might want to update from a basic plan to an advanced plan that increases the frequency of your service, or they might want to decrease the number of users for a software product. You can update the Subscription for them in such cases, either immediately or at the end of the current billing cycle.
Watch Out!
You can only update Subscriptions in the authenticated and active states. Subscriptions in the created, pending or halted state cannot be updated. There is no state change when a Subscription is updated. Know more about the Subscription states.
You cannot update a Subscription if the difference amount after updating a Subscription (credit or refund) is less than the update quantity x the smallest currency subunit.

Update Subscriptions Immediately
When you update a Subscription immediately, you may have to perform the following:

Charge the customer an extra amount
Refund an amount to the customer

If the remaining amount for the original Subscription is the same as the amount to be charged for the updated Subscription, no charge or refund needs to be done.
Handy Tips
If you are updating a Subscription (amount in dollars), ensure that the prorated amount difference between the existing and new plans is at least 50 currency subunits, that is, $0.5. You will get an error if the amount difference between the two plans is less than $0.5.
This is valid only when you update a Subscription immediately.

Charge a Customer Extra
When upgrading a plan or increasing the number of users, you may have to charge a customer an extra amount. In such scenarios, Razorpay creates an invoice and charges the customer the difference amount.
If the charge is successful, the invoice is sent to the customer only if Razorpay handles the customer's notifications.
You will be notified via the subscription.updated webhook.
If the charge fails, the Subscription is not updated.
Refund Money to a Customer
When downgrading a plan or reducing the number of users, you might have to give the customer a refund. In such scenarios, Razorpay refunds the amount to the customer.
You will be notified about this via the subscription.updated webhook.
Credit Note
A refund to a customer is done using a Credit Note. Credit notes are similar to add-ons and help you in reconciliation.

Credit notes are not created against invoices. They are created against the total value of payments made by the customer. This means that only one credit note is created even if refunds have to be made against multiple invoices.
You can view credit notes on the Dashboard against the respective Subscription.
The credit notes are refunded automatically.

A credit note can have two states:

created: The initial state of a credit note. A credit note stays in this state until a full refund is made to the customer.
refunded: The final state of a refund. A credit note moves to this state once the refund is successfully processed.

Example Scenario - Same Billing Frequency
