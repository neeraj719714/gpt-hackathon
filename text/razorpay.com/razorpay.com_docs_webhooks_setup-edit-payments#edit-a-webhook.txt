Set Up Webhooks
Watch this video to see how to set up a webhook.

To set up webhooks:


Log in to the Razorpay Dashboard and navigate to Accounts & Settings.


Click Webhooks under Website and app settings.


Click the + Add New Webhook button.



In the Webhook Setup pop-up page:


Enter the URL where you want to receive the webhook payload when an event is triggered. We recommend using an HTTPS URL.
Handy Tips
You can set up to 30 URLs to receive Webhook notifications. Webhooks can only be delivered to public URLs.
If your URL contains razorpay as a domain, you will not be able to add the URL and will receive an error.
If you attempt to save a localhost endpoint as part of a webhook setup, you will notice an error. Know more about testing Webhooks on an application running on localhost.



Enter a Secret for the webhook endpoint. The secret is used to validate that the webhook is from Razorpay. Do not expose the secret publicly. Know more about how to validate webhooks.
Handy Tips
When setting up the webhook, you will be asked to specify a secret. Using this secret, you can validate that the webhook is from Razorpay. Entering the secret is optional but recommended. The secret should never be exposed publicly.
The webhook secret does not need to be the merchant secret key provided by Razorpay.



In the Alert Email field, enter the email address to which the notifications should be sent in case of webhook failure. You will receive webhook related notifications like failures, deactivation and so on.


Select the required events from the list of Active Events.






Click Create Webhook. After you set a webhook, it appears on the list of webhooks.



You can select the webhook and click Edit to make more changes.

Deactivation
All webhook responses must return a status code in the range 2XX within a window of 5 seconds. If we receive response codes other than this or the request times out, it is considered a failure.
On failure, a webhook is re-tried at progressive intervals of time, defined in the exponential back-off policy, for 24 hours. If the failures continue for 24 hours, the webhook is disabled. You need to enable the webhook from the Razorpay Dashboard after fixing the errors at your end. Know more about enabling Webhooks.
Handy TipsWhen a webhook gets disabled, you receive an email notification on the email id you configured while setting up the webhooks.
Enable/Disable a Webhook

Log in to the Razorpay Dashboard and navigate to Account & Settings â Webhooks.
In the list, select the webhook you want to edit.
Change the status to Enabled or Disabled in the right panel as required.



Delete a Webhook
To delete a webhook:

Log in to the Razorpay Dashboard and navigate to Account & Settings â Webhooks.
In the list, select the webhook that you want to delete.
In the right panel, click Delete. Click Yes, Delete in the dialogue box to confirm.
