Card Tokenisation Explained Card Tokenisation is the process whereby the original card number is replaced with a surrogate value called a token. The relationship between the token number and the original card number is stored in a vault owned by either the card network or the issuing bank. Razorpay acts as a Token Requestor, connecting businesses to card networks andâ/or issuing banks. Alternately, if a business is a Token Requestor, Razorpay still acts as a layer connecting the business with card networks and/or issuing banks.Want to learn more?
