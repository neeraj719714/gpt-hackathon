Handy Tips
The payload for a Webhook is a snapshot of the entity when the event occurred.
For example, when a customer makes a payment, its status changes to authorized. It can then immediately move to the captured state.
The payment can be in the captured state when the payment.authorized Webhook is fired. However, the payload for the payment.authorized event contains details of the events when the payment was authorised, not when it was captured.
In case of network tokenised cards, the last 4 digits will be of the tokenised card and not the actual card.

Know more about webhooks and check the sample payloads.
