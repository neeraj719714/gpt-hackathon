Orders


Payments


Direct Transfer


Prerequisites


Ensure the feature flag has been enabled to opt for the Direct Transfers. Contact our support team for more information.


Create Linked Accounts, have them ready and accessible.
Watch Out!Linked Accounts have a cooling period of 24 hours, only after which you can initiate transfers.


Provide dashboard access to the Linked Accounts to ensure transparency between the two parties, such as:

Linked Account holders can also download reports for further processing and reconciliation.
Linked Account holders can view all transactions reflected on one single dashboard.



Transfer via Orders
In this method, the transfers can be set up at the time of order creation. After the payment is captured and the order is paid, the transfer is automatically created and settled to the respective Linked Accounts.
Watch Out!The Transfers set up during order creation can only be done using APIs.
This eliminates the extra step of triggering the Direct Transfers or Transfers via Payments API.
To initiate transfers while creating orders:

Create an Order using the Transfer via Orders API.
Capture the Payment.
Set up the  webhook event transfer.processed.

Watch Out!
You cannot create transfer on an order which has partial_payment parameter enabled. Ensure that this parameter is set to 0.
You cannot create transfers on an order for international currencies. Currently, this feature is available for INR currency only.
If a Transfer via Order initiated by you fails, we will retry this transfer starting from the next day on consecutive days. There will be a maximum of 3 retries.

Transfers via Payments
You can initiate a transfer from a payment received from a customer. This can be done from the Dashboard or using the Create Transfers from Payments API.
Checklist for Dashboard operation


Ensure the payment completed is in INR.


Ensure the payment through which you want to make a transfer is in the captured state.


Ensure the amount does not exceed the initial payment amount.


Ensure the amount you want to transfer to a Linked Account is less than the initial amount.
Watch Out!You must subtract fees & tax to calculate the amount that is to be allowed to transfer.
