With Instant Settlements (earlier known as On-demand Settlement APIs), you get access to your funds as and when you want.
Normally, you would receive settlements according to your settlement cycle. Razorpay Instant Settlements helps to reduce your settlement period from T+2 days (default settlement cycle) to a few minutes (from the time of the transaction), thus enabling your business to avoid cash-flow challenges and prepare better for working capital requirements.
Feature RequestThis is an on-demand feature. Please raise a request with our Support team to get this feature activated on your Razorpay account.
You can try out our APIs on the Razorpay Postman Public Workspace.
