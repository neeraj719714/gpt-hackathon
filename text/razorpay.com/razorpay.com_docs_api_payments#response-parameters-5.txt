After the customer's bank authorises the payment, you must verify if the authorised amount deducted from the customer's account is the same as the amount paid by the customer on your website or app.
You can configure automatic capture of payments on the Razorpay Dashboard.
Use the above endpoint to change the payment status from authorized to captured.
