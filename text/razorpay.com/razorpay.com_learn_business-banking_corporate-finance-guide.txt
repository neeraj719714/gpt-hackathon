Types of Corporate Finance
1. Equity Financing: This type of financing involves raising capital by issuing shares of stock to investors. It is the process of raising capital by selling shares to investors and the public.
2. Debt Financing: This type of financing involves borrowing money from lenders such as banks, institutions, and other financial institutions. The company must repay the loan with interest over a predetermined period of time.
3. Venture Capital: Venture capital is financing provided by venture capital firms or professional investors to start–up companies or other businesses with the potential for long–term growth.
4. Mergers and Acquisitions: Mergers and acquisitions are transactions in which two companies combine to form one larger company. The larger company is usually the acquirer, while the smaller company is usually the target. The acquirer usually pays a premium to the target in order to obtain control over it.
5. Private Equity Financing: Private equity financing refers to the issuance of securities to private investors in exchange for capital. Private equity financing is typically used to finance companies without access to public capital markets.
6. Leveraged Buyouts: Leveraged buyouts involve the use of debt financing to acquire a company. The acquirer typically takes out a loan to purchase the target company and then uses the target company‘s assets as collateral for the loan.
7. Initial Public Offerings: An initial public offering (IPO) is a type of public offering in which shares of a company are sold to investors. IPOs are typically used to fund the expansion of a company.
8. Mezzanine Financing: Mezzanine financing is a type of financing that combines debt and equity. The debt portion is typically referred to as a mezzanine loan, while the equity portion is called a mezzanine equity investment.
9. Asset-Backed Financing: Asset–backed financing is a type of financing in which assets are used as collateral for a loan. The assets can include accounts receivable, inventory, machinery, and real estate.
Top Benefits of Corporate Finance
Here are some of the major benefits of corporate financing. 
1. Efficient business operations
Well-planned corporate finance ensures that your business’ finances are in top shape and capital allocation is streamlined effectively. 
This means that your loans are cleared on time, you are able to buy raw materials as required, employee salaries are paid on time, new product launches go as planned, and marketing efforts for said new products as well as the existing ones are well-budgeted.
2. Research and development
Market and product research require considerable funding resources, both material and human, to be conducted effectively. Running out of funding at any point during the process would mean a lot of work and work hours going to waste. Well-planned corporate finance would help ensure steady financial support for research efforts that ultimately help your business succeed.
3. Keeps expansion plans on track
Modern techniques and equipment are necessary for the diversification and expansion of an enterprise. Planning your corporate finance in advance will ensure that you have a steady flow of funds to acquire future-forward technology and equipment for your business.
4. Operation management
Corporate finance plays a vital role in the coordination and control of various activities in an enterprise. For instance, your production will drop if the finance department does not offer sufficient finance to buy raw materials and meet other daily financial needs for running the production unit smoothly. This would further make sales suffer, and eventually, affect your profits.
5. Timely payment of fees & taxes
Your organisation needs to pay taxes to the government, which includes Goods and Service Tax (GST) and Income Tax. You may also be required to pay fees to the Registrar of Companies. Accounting for these while planning your corporate finance helps pay these fees and taxes.
6. Risk management
Your company needs to manage several risks like a loss because of natural calamity, sudden drop in sales, loss due to strikes, etc. Provisioning for these while planning your corporate finance proves to help manage such risks.
7. Streamlined Asset allocation
Well-planned corporate finance helps you keep funds handy for the replacement of fixed assets that get worn out over the years.
8. Interest and dividend payments 
The right amount and timely arranged corporate finance help companies pay interest to banks or creditors as well as dividends to shareholders in a timely and efficient manner.
9. Improves decision-making
A majority of the vital business decisions in organisations are determined by considering fund availability. Performing any function independently without finance is challenging in an enterprise. 
Activities that govern corporate finance
The top three activities that primarily govern corporate financing are: 


Return of capital and dividends


This requires corporate managers to decide whether to distribute the earnings to shareholders in the form of share buybacks or dividends or to retain the excess earnings of a business for future operational requirements and investments.
Retained earnings that are not distributed to shareholders should be utilised to fund the expansion of a business. It does not dilute the value of equity by issuing more shares or incurring additional debts. That’s why this often proves to be the best source of funds.
Eventually, as someone managing corporate finance, you must pursue a capital investment if there are chances of earning a rate of return on it, which is higher than the organisation’s cost of capital. Otherwise, they must return the excess capital to shareholders through share buybacks or dividends.


Capital budgeting and investments


Capital budgeting and investing include planning regarding where to place the long-term capital assets of an organisation to produce the highest risk-adjusted returns. This involves deciding whether to pursue an investment opportunity or not and is accomplished via extensive financial analysis.
By utilising financial accounting tools, you can estimate cash flows from proposed capital projects, can compare planned investments with projected income, identify capital expenditures, and decide which projects you should include in the capital budget.
Financial modelling is utilised to forecast an investment opportunity’s economic impact and compare alternative projects. Many times, an analyst uses the Net Present Value (NPV) and Internal Rate of Return (IRR) to draw a comparison between projects and choose the optimal one.


Capital Financing


Capital financing includes decisions regarding how to finance capital investments optimally via the business’ debt, equity, or a combination of both.
You can acquire long-term funding for major capital investments or expenditures by issuing debt securities in the market via investment banks, or by selling company stock.
The key is to balance the two sources (debt and equity). Eventually, corporate finance professionals optimise the capital structure of an organisation by reducing its WACC (Weighted Average Cost of Capital) as much as possible.
Corporate Banking services
Corporate banking services typically comprise of 


Treasury services


Treasury services are used to manage the working capital needs of organisations. As these services help facilitate currency conversion, they are highly important for MNCs.


Employer services


Commercial financial institutions offer services like employee payroll facilities and a selection of healthcare and retirement plans.


Fixed asset requirement financing


This proves to be vital for corporates who are engaged in capital-intensive industries like information technology, heavy machinery manufacturing, transportation, etc. Financial institutions facilitate lease agreements and customised loans for the purpose of buying machinery, equipment, etc.


Corporate net banking


Corporate net banking allows corporate customers or non-individual customers like companies, trusts, proprietorship concerns, partnerships, firms, etc., to do banking online anytime and anywhere. This facility enables seamless processing of bulk transactions via Internal Funds Transfer/ RTGS and Salary Payments, hence lowering the turnaround time effectively.

Commercial services


Banks extend services like analyses of real assets, equity and debt restructuring, leverage analysis, portfolio analysis, etc. Some other vital services for corporate clients are underwriters for IPOs (initial public offerings), asset management services, etc.


Credit


Through corporate banking, you can opt for loans and other credit-related products. Notably, credit facilities contribute the biggest share of profits for commercial financial institutions. However, one must note that the interest rates that are imposed on loans are considerably high owing to the risk factor associated with lending to corporate customers.
As a business owner in India, you can raise corporate finance from multiple reputed financial institutions. These lenders provide an array of loans that proves helps you address your capital requirements. Some of their offerings include SME/MSME loans, unsecured business loans, machinery and plant loans, etc. Further, these come with flexible tenures, enabling you to tailor their repayment timelines based on your cash flow.
Example of Corporate Finance
Corporate finance involves the financial decisions a business makes to reach its goals.
An example of corporate finance could be a business deciding to acquire another business to expand its product offerings. This decision would involve analyzing the potential target, performing due diligence, and negotiating a deal that is beneficial to the company.
The company would then need to secure financing, such as issuing bonds or obtaining a loan, to fund the acquisition. After the deal is complete, the company would need to integrate the new business into its operations and ensure that the acquisition meets its financial objectives.
FAQs
