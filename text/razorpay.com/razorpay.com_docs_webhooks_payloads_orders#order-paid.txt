Orders and payments go hand-in-hand. Once a payment is captured, the order is marked paid.  This is reflected in the order.paid and payment.captured webhook events as well. These events are triggered when the payment associated with the order is captured.

Watch Out!If you have changed your webhook secret, remember to use the old secret for webhook signature validation while retrying older requests. Using the new secret will lead to signature mismatch.
Do Not Parse or Cast the Webhook Request BodyWhile generating a signature at your end, ensure that the webhook body is passed as an argument in the raw webhook request body. Do not parse or cast the webhook request body.
