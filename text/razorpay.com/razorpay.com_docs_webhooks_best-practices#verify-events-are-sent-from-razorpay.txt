Take a look at these best practices to ensure your webhooks remain secure and function seamlessly with your integration.
Delivery Attempts and Retries
Every event that receives a non-2xx response is considered an event delivery failure by Razorpay's system. If there is a delivery failure, we retry the delivery in exponential backoff policy for 24 hours after event creation timestamp.
Watch Out!Webhooks are delivered in near real-time and are asynchronous. For business-critical, synchronous use cases, you may choose to poll out APIs as well.
Disable Logic
A webhook is retried at progressive intervals of time on failure, defined in the exponential backoff policy, for 24 hours. If the webhooks continue to fail for 24 hours, the webhook is disabled. You need to enable the webhook from the Razorpay Dashboard or RazorpayX Dashboard after fixing the errors at your end.
Whenever a webhook is disabled, you are notified on your Alert Email Address as configured during webhook setup. Suppose you had not provided an Alert Email Address during webhook set up. In that case, we send an email to the email address configured under Account & Settings on the Razorpay Dashboard or RazorpayX Dashboard.
Watch Out!Please note that Razorpay considers any non-2xx response as an event delivery failure. Please make sure the API responds with 2xx when you successfully consume the event at your end.
You can also manually disable webhooks from the Razorpay and RazorpayX Dashboards.

Event Handling
Correct handling of webhook events is crucial to ensuring your integration's business logic works as expected.
Handle Duplicate Events
There could be scenarios where your endpoint might receive the same webhook event multiple times. This is an expected behaviour based on the webhook design. In such a scenario, we recommend you to follow Idempotency.
You could be receiving the same events multiple times as Razorpay follows at-least-once delivery semantics. In this approach, if we do not receive a successful response from your server, we resend the webhook. There could be situations where your server accepts the event but fails to respond in 5 seconds. In such cases, the session is marked timeout. It is assumed that the webhook was not processed and is sent again.
Handy TipsTo prevent an event from being missed:
Ensure you configure your server to handle or receive the same event details multiple times.
Check the value of the x-razorpay-event-id in the webhook request header. The value for this header is unique per event and can help you determine the duplicity of a webhook event.

Order Of Events
Ideally, you should receive a webhook in the order in which the webhook events occur. However, you may not always receive the webhooks in order. Know more about Order of Webhooks.
Security
Maintaining your endpoints secure is crucial to protecting your customer's information. Razorpay provides various methods to verify that events are securely coming from us.
Receive events with an HTTPS server
Razorpay Production environment does not support the older versions of TLS 1.0 and 1.1 due to security concerns around these protocols. The TLS protocol is used to encrypt your servers communications with Razorpay, so your integration must use the latest version (TLS 1.2 is much more secure than its predecessors). As an integration checklist, please whitelist all the  Webhook IPs.
Verify events are sent from Razorpay
You can verify webhook signatures to confirm that received events are sent from Razorpay.
You can also resolve webhook signature validation errors.
