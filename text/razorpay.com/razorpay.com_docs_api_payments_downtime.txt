These downtimes are due to technical issues or outages at Razorpay's partner or issuing banks. Razorpay informs you about the downtime to communicate it to your customers and display only the unaffected payment methods while accepting payments from them.
You can poll the API or configure Webhooks to be notified of the downtimes and plan the remediation steps accordingly.
Downtime communication for the payment methods such as cards, netbanking, UPI and wallet is available.
You can try out our APIs on the Razorpay Postman Public Workspace.
