title: Refund Communication
desc: Check the refund-related emails sent to your customers after the refunds are initiated.

If a customer is asking for a refund, the banking partner provides a unique reference number (either RRN, ARN or UTR) when a refund is processed. The customer can use this reference number to track the refund status with the bank.

As a customer, you will be notified of the specific payment to be refunded in 7-10 working days.
